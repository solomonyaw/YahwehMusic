   Love this direction, Solomon — a README in **HTML** is perfect for GitHub and for clearly expressing the vision 🙌
Below is a **clean, well-structured HTML README** you can drop directly into your repository.

You can save this as **`README.html`** or paste it into a GitHub README that supports HTML rendering.

    <h1>Yahweh Music</h1>
    <p><strong>Yahweh Music</strong> is a gospel music platform dedicated to spreading the pure and unadulterated Word of God through music, using <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> as a creative tool.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p>
        <em>“Let everything that has breath praise the Lord.” — Psalm 150:6</em>
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>🎵 Vision & Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      Yahweh Music exists to glorify God by merging faith, music, and technology.
      Artificial Intelligence is used not as a replacement for worship, but as an
      instrument to explore new sounds, enhance creativity, and communicate eternal
      biblical truths in a modern and impactful way.
    </p>

    <p>
      The mission is to reach hearts across cultures and generations, pointing listeners
      back to Christ, true faith, and spiritual discernment.
    </p>

    <h2>📀 Music Projects</h2>
    <p>So far, Yahweh Music has released three major music projects:</p>

    <h3>Grace and Glory</h3>
    <p>
      <em>Grace and Glory</em> is a worship-focused album centered on God’s redemptive
      grace and the glory revealed through Jesus Christ. The songs encourage reflection,
      gratitude, and sincere worship.
    </p>

    <h3>Holy Sweat</h3>
    <p>
      <em>Holy Sweat</em> was inspired by the timeless book <strong>Holy Sweat</strong>
      written by <strong>Tim Hansel</strong>. The album draws deeply from the message
      that faith is not passive but active—lived out through discipline, courage,
      perseverance, and obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each song reflects themes of adventure, peak performance, servant leadership,
      and the call to turn belief into action by fully committing one’s life and gifts to God.
    </p>

    <h3>The Seven Church Ages</h3>
    <p>
      <em>The Seven Church Ages</em> album is inspired by the teachings found in
      <strong>William Marrion Branham’s</strong> book
      <em>An Exposition of the Seven Church Ages</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through spoken word and music, the project reflects the spiritual messages,
      warnings, and promises given to the seven church ages recorded in the Book of Revelation,
      pointing listeners back to Christ and spiritual truth.
    </p>

    <h2>🔥 Upcoming Release</h2>
    <h3>The Original Sin (Single)</h3>
    <p>
      <em>The Original Sin</em> is an upcoming single that explores the fall of man,
      divine truth, and God’s redemptive plan. The song invites deep reflection on
      obedience, revelation, and restoration through Christ.
    </p>
